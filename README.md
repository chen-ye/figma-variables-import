# Figma Variables Import plugin

This plugin for the beta version of Figma allows you to import design tokens in the [Design Token Community Group](https://design-tokens.github.io/community-group/format/) format as Figma Variables.

It's a work in progress, and is not a supported product—just a little internal tool that we use.
